-- A smaller version of one of the tasks from the recent FP exam.

-- Push n is meant to push the value n on the stack
-- Map f is meant to apply f to *all* of the items in the stack in place, so without removing them

-- Imlement the interpreter for our stack machine, given a list of instructions.
-- You can use a helper for the "recursion" at first, if you want to, but implement the "recursive part" using foldl afterwards.
-- We return the final state of the stack.
-- Note the Maybe, because we can't be sure that Oper will always succeed. Once we fail, we shouldn't attemp to recover.
-- The maybeMap function is quite useful for some of the cases here.

fact :: Nat -> Nat

-- EXERCISE
-- If Nats can be converted to "n times applications" via foldNat,
-- is it perhaps true that "n times applications" can also be converted to Nats somehow?
--
-- You can ignore this bit below if you want to - just assume the forall means "the passed function must be polymorphic over a"
-- START "forall explanation"
-- Usually when we have a polymorphic function, like id :: a -> a
-- the *caller* chooses what a will be - when I write id 'a', I instantiate a with Char, so id becomes id :: Char -> Char
-- However, here we will need our function to work for any a, and so we must *require* something of the caller -
-- that they provide a function working *for any* a - meaning *we*(the callee) can decide what a to apply it for.
-- As a further example, consider
-- f :: (a -> a) -> Bool
-- f g = g True
-- this does *not* compile - let's assume it did.
-- if we have
-- h :: Int -> Int
-- h x = x + 1
-- then the caller would be able to write f h, (as they pick what a is) which is not valid,
-- since h requires its argument and return types to be Int, and True :: Bool
-- instead
-- f :: (forall a. a -> a) -> Bool
-- f g = g True
-- compiles, and now the caller cannot do f h, since the passed h needs to work *for any* a, while h :: Int -> Int
-- END "forall explanation"
--
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> iterateToNat (\f x -> f (f (f x)))
-- Suc (Suc (Suc Zero))

natToIterate :: Nat -> (a -> a) -> a -> a

-- EXERCISE
-- Hey, if we can convert between Natural (the type argument to iterateToNat), now with a synonym) and Nat without losing information
-- wouldn't that mean that they are equivalent, and we can do the same things with both?
-- let's reimplement some of them, with Natural
-- These are called "church encoded" natural numbers - they're used to encode natural numbers, when the only thing you "have" is functions.
--
-- Here's some exposition:
-- As you saw in the iterateToNat example, these Naturals are essentially applying some function to some value a number of times.
-- The idea is that we represent the number n as applying a function f n times to a value v.
-- For example:
-- 0 is represented by \f v -> v
zero :: Natural
zero f v = v
-- 1 is represented by \f v -> f v
-- 2 is represented by \f v -> f (f v)
-- 3 is represented by \f v -> f (f (f v))
-- and so on
-- With this function, we need to somehow "add another f".
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> iterateToNat zero
-- Zero
-- >>> iterateToNat $ suc $ suc zero
-- Suc (Suc Zero)
-- >>> natToInteger $ iterateToNat $ suc $ natToIterate $ integerToNat 5
-- 6
suc :: Natural -> Natural

-- EXERCISE
-- We can also add these. Here we need to think about how to add f n times to another Natural.
-- Note that usually
-- add n m = n suc m
-- Would be ok as a definition, however, due to some constraints in how ghc works, is not accepted (resolved in ghc 9.2 with ImpredicativeTypes)
-- EXAMPLES
-- >>> iterateToNat $ add (suc (suc zero)) zero
-- Suc (Suc Zero)
-- >>> iterateToNat $ add (suc (suc zero)) (suc (suc (suc zero)))
-- Suc (Suc (Suc (Suc (Suc Zero))))
-- >>> natToInteger $ iterateToNat $ add (suc (suc zero)) (suc (suc (suc (suc zero))))
-- 6
add :: Natural -> Natural -> Natural
add n m = undefined

-- EXERCISE
-- Now multiply them
-- >>> iterateToNat $ mult (suc (suc zero)) zero
-- Zero
-- >>> iterateToNat $ mult zero (suc (suc zero))
-- Zero
-- >>> iterateToNat $ mult (suc (suc zero)) (suc (suc zero))
-- Suc (Suc (Suc (Suc Zero)))
-- >>> natToInteger $ iterateToNat $ mult (suc (suc zero)) (suc (suc (suc zero)))
-- 6
mult :: Natural -> Natural -> Natural
mult n m = undefined

-- Is the same true for lists? Is there some function type that is "isomorphic" to lists - you can convert
-- back and forth between lists and the function, without losing data? Like how Natural is to Nat
-- (or if you prefer - can you express lists by only using lambdas?)
